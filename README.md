# MINI_GAME_HUB_
The Mini Game Hub !  I've built a full-stack application featuring three classic games:  Tic-Tac-Toe: A 2-player game with a clean interface. Snake: A canvas-based game with persistent high scores powered by a PostgreSQL database. Rock Paper Scissors: Play against the computer with score tracking.
